## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

Doing things as simple as updating a program can become time consuming if the program developers do not do their job correctly. Sometimes silly things like deleting the list of recent files can be a process that requires some googling before doing so, and therefore a lot of time wasted in performing these tasks.
That's exactly why **BashBoost** is here! A collection of shell scripts that will allow you to automate tasks in your Debian. They may also work on other systems, but compatibility is not assured.
Here is a small list of what our scripts are capable of doing:
* Clear the list of recent files
* Update programs like Discord
